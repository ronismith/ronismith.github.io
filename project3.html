  <p>
  I wanted to create a fantasy of a room gone completely chaotic and messy. I took inspiration from my dorm, and let my imagination run. My main challenge was in straddling the line between surrealism and realism.</p>
  <br />
  <p>
  When I undertook this challenge I focused mainly on the hanger object, which I got off of Poly. I inflated them, and put them on a hill of this goo. I added a hand poking out of the goo to give the scene a sense of impending danger. The door, behind the viewer in VR, is made to be smaller than the viewer and imply there is no possibility of escape.
